# Pet Finder Express Application

Users take a ten question quiz and are matched up with a pet that most closely matches their responses. This project was built as part of the homework for the UC Davis Extension Bootcamp. The original theme of the assignment was a friend finding or dating application. However, I immediately thought to turn this into a pet finder application given that I volunteer at the Bradshaw Animal Shelter in Sacramento as a Feline Adoption Counselor and often deal with matching people with pets. I can see myself modifying this application in the future for use as the shelter as a fun way for guests to get to know the animals. This application would also be a great way to feature animals that often get overlooked at the shelter. 

The front end was created already, but I added styling to the button on the home and survey page from Colt Steele's The Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. For the back-end, I created the server using Express npm package. The application has two pages in total, the second of which is the survey. I built an API that takes the user's input and compares it to scores within an array of objects for each pet. 

The application was deployed to Heroku and can be viewed at the following URL:

## Challenges and Learning Summary

The challenges of this application were working with .post and understanding where you need to look to see if your code is working. When working on the front-end versus the back-end, there are different ways for you to see what you are doing. I found in working with the back-end that I was testing my code less often, simply because it was slightly more inconvenient. However, I was diligent with reminding myself to check the code as often as I would normally. All in all, I rather enjoy working with the back-end, and in a case like this when scaling, I would love to create a database to store the scores for all users and pets. 

Another aspect of challenge was having the front end already built out. I know that this was a good exercise, because it meant I needed to read someone else's code and see how mine was going to intermingle with it. This scenario will appear in my professional career later, so it is helpful to face this type of assignment now, even if I like building application entirely from scratch. 

This was the first time that I have pushed a site to Heroku, and I found the documentation very straightforward. I got the site up and running within a couple minutes.
